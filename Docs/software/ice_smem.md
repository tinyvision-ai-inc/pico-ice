It is wrapping the pico-sdk calls for setting-up DMA channels and
communicate to serial memories through SPI, such as SRAM, FLASH, EEPROM...

Higher-level APIs make use of this for communication with each kind of memory.

> BUG: currently does not support multiple calls to `ice_smem_init()`,
> even with different IRQ numbers.
> Only affects the `_async` family of functions.


### `#define ICE_SMEM_FLASH_PAGE_SIZE`

The size of a memory page in bytes, used by various commands below.


### `void ice_smem_init(uint baudrate_hz, int irq)`

`baudrate_hz` - Speed of the transfer in Hz, anything supported by
[`spi_init()`](https://raspberrypi.github.io/pico-sdk-doxygen/group__hardware__spi.html).

`irq` - The IRQ number: either `DMA_IRQ_0` or `DMA_IRQ_1`, or `-1` for synchronous mode.

Initialize the serial memory


### `void ice_smem_await_async_completion(void)`

Wait that our own ongoing transaction completes.


### `bool ice_smem_is_async_complete(void)`

Return `true` when the ongoing asynchronous transfer is completed.


### `void ice_smem_deinit(void)`

Release hardware resources used by the `ice_smem.h` library.


### `void ice_smem_output_command(int cs_pin, const uint8_t* command, uint32_t command_size, const void* data, uint32_t data_size)`

`cs_pin` - Chip select pin to use in the SPI transaction.

`command` - Buffer of commands to send first.

`command_size` - Size of this buffer.

`data` - Buffer of data to send after the commands.

`data_size` - Size of this buffer.

Send the two buffers in a single SPI transaction without using DMA.

Low-level function to use for building custom commands that write data.


### `void ice_smem_output_command_async(int cs_pin, const uint8_t* command, uint32_t command_size, const void* data, uint32_t data_size, void (*callback)(void *), void* context)`

`callback` - Pointer to a function that will be executed upon completion of an SPI transfer (with DMA).

`context` - Pointer passed to that function upon completion.

Async version of the command above.
(call `ice_mem_await_async_completion()` and `ice_smem_is_async_complete()` above),
and using DMA for transfers.

Low-level function to use for building custom commands that write data.


### `void ice_smem_input_command(int cs_pin, const uint8_t* command, uint32_t command_size, void* data, uint32_t data_size)`

`cs_pin` - Chip select pin to use in the SPI transaction.

`command` - Buffer of commands to send first.

`command_size` - Size of this buffer.

`data` - Buffer receiving the data read after the commands.

`data_size` - Size of this buffer.

Send the first buffer, then receive data on the second buffer, in a single SPI transaction, using DMA.

Low-level function to use for building custom commands that read data.


### `void ice_smem_input_command_async(int cs_pin, const uint8_t* command, uint32_t command_size, void* data, uint32_t data_size, ice_smem_callback_t callback, void* context)`

`callback` - Pointer to a function that will be executed upon completion of an SPI transfer (with DMA).

`context` - Pointer passed to that function upon completion.

This is the same version as above, but not blocking
(call `ice_mem_await_async_completion()` and `ice_smem_is_async_complete()` above),
and using DMA for transfers.

Low-level function to use for building custom commands that read data.


### `uint8_t ice_smem_get_status(int cs_pin)`

`cs_pin` - Chip select pin to use in the SPI transaction.

Return the serial chip status, containing information about its writable state, ongoing transaction...


### `void ice_smem_erase_chip(int cs_pin)`

`cs_pin` - Chip select pin to use in the SPI transaction.

Issue a command to erase the whole chip.


### `void ice_smem_erase_sector(int cs_pin, uint32_t addr)`

`cs_pin` - Chip select pin to use in the SPI transaction.

`addr` - Address to erase. Must be a multiple of ICE_SMEM_FLASH_PAGE_SIZE.

Issue a command to erase a "sector", which is a region of `ICE_SMEM_FLASH_PAGE_SIZE` bytes.


### `void ice_smem_enable_write(int cs_pin)`

`cs_pin` - Chip select pin to use in the SPI transaction.

Issue a command to allow writing data to the chip.
Typically to be inserted before any command that modifies any content.


### `void ice_smem_disable_write(int cs_pin)`

`cs_pin` - Chip select pin to use in the SPI transaction.

Issue a command to disallow writing data to the chip.


### `void ice_smem_write(int cs_pin, uint32_t addr, const void *data, uint32_t data_size)`

`cs_pin` - Chip select pin to use in the SPI transaction.

`addr` - Address to read from. Must be a multiple of ICE_SMEM_FLASH_PAGE_SIZE.

`data` - Buffer of data to send after the commands.

`data_size` - Size of this buffer.

Issue a write command, modifying the content of the flash.
See also `ice_smem_enable_write()`.


### `void ice_smem_write_async(int cs_pin, uint32_t dest_addr, const void *src, uint32_t size, ice_smem_callback_t callback, void *context)`

`callback` - Pointer to a function that will be executed upon completion of an SPI transfer (with DMA).

`context` - Pointer passed to that function upon completion.

Async version of the command above.


### `void ice_smem_read(int cs_pin, void *dest, uint32_t src_addr, uint32_t size)`

`cs_pin` - Chip select pin to use in the SPI transaction.

`addr` - Address to write at. Can be any value in range.

`data` - Buffer of data to send after the commands.

`data_size` - Size of this buffer.

Issue a read command, modifying the content of the flash.
See also `ice_smem_enable_write()`.

Woken-up by `ice_smem_power_on()`.


### `void ice_smem_power_on(int cs_pin)`

`cs_pin` - Chip select pin to use in the SPI transaction.

Turn power on, taking the chip out of sleep mode.
